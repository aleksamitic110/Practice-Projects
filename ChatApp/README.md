# ChatApp ðŸ’¬

ChatApp is a simple peer-to-peer chat application built with C# and Windows Forms.  
It allows two users to exchange messages over TCP/IP.

## Features
- Server and client mode
- Basic text messaging
- Runs locally or on LAN

## How to use
1. Run the app on two machines (or two instances).
2. On one, enter a port (e.g. 9000) and click **Start**.
3. On the other, enter the first machine's IP and same port, then click **Connect**.
4. Type a message and click **Send**.

## Notes
- Works only between two users at a time.
- Make sure the firewall allows the chosen port.
