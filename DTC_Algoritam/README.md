# DTC - Permutation Encryption

This project implements a simple permutation-based encryption and decryption of text.

## How it works

- Input a sentence to encrypt or decrypt.
- Specify the number of row permutations and enter their index pairs.
- Specify the number of column permutations and enter their index pairs.
- The program applies these permutations to encrypt or decrypt the sentence.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the sentence to process.
3. Enter the number of row permutations and the permutation indices.
4. Enter the number of column permutations and the permutation indices.
5. View the encrypted and decrypted output.
